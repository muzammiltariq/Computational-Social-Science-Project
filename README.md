# Computational-Social-Science-Project
This was the project me and my group partners Romesa Iftikhar and Fatima Zehra did for the course CS/SDP 262 Computational Social Science. It is a simple simulation about the affect of entrepreneurship on the mental health of young people written in netlogo. It does so by recording how the amount of influencers changes with increase in time and followers.
